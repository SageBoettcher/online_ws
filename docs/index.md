Welcome to **Introduction to Online Experiments**, prepared by the [Brain & Cognition Lab](http://www.brainandcognition.org/). In this resource we aim at *not only* collating important information about online testing, *but also* providing step-by-step guides for a successful transition to online experimentation.

Currently, the resource is focused on implementing online studies within the [PsychoPy/Pavlovia](https://psychopy.org/) ecosystem. We aim at gradually covering an increasing amount of alternative options.

The content in this resource is of general relevance, but the specific examples are strongly tailored to the University of Oxford, specifically the Departments of Experimental Psychology and Psychiatry. Thus, if you are a member of these Departments, you can essentially follow the steps 1:1. If you are a visitor from a different Department, University or Country, you will need to sometimes find solutions which are a bit more specific to your current environment. These cases are however quite rare and usually pertain to some form of administrative task. Thus, the majority of the content should be of relevance to anybody interested in embarking on the road to online experimentation.


We hope you enjoy this resource and please let us know in case you want to contribute, on the [GitHub repository which supports this website] (https://github.com/mkallmayer/online_ws/tree/master/docs).

# Before you click away
Before embarking on the chapters in this resource, we recommend reading this [short introductory paper](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/tr76d) ([Sauter, Draschkow, & Mack, 2020](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/tr76d)). We hope that this will provide a brief overview of basic concepts, as well as outline the different solutions available to researchers.

For ease, we have embedded it into this landing page.
